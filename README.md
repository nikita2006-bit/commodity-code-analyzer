# commodity-code-analyzer
This Python script processes an Excel file with trade/export data, groups the results by commodity code (CN/Intrastat), and categorizes them based on the `BTOM` column (`low` or `medium`). If `medium`, the script also breaks results down by `EHC` values. It outputs a clean multi-sheet Excel file.
